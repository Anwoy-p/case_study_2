# case_study_2
 # over view 
 The case study is a kaggle competition in which one has to detect
blindness before it happens . The idea is to detect Diabetic
retinopathy which is the leading cause of blindness among the
working aged adult from the retina scanned images . 

 # My first cut solution 
 My approach to the solution was that if the irregularities in a retina scaned image 
 could be enhanced then it would be very useful for the model for which I used thresolding 
 technique. Also the data set we are dealing with in this competition is highly imbalanced.
 In order to handle data imbalance I have used upsampling.
